        <h3> Musica - I Love You</h3>
        <hr>
        <pre>
            It's not true
            Tell me I’ve been lied to
            Crying isn't like you, ooh
            What the hell did I do?
            Never been the type to
            Let someone see right through, ooh

            Maybe won't you take it back?
            Say you were tryna make me laugh
            And nothing has to change today
            You didn’t mean to say: I love you
            I love you
            And I don't want to, ooh

            Up all night
            On another red-eye
            We wish we never learned to fly
            Maybe we should just try
            To tell ourselves a good lie
            Didn't mean to make you cry, I

            Maybe won't you take it back?
            Say you were tryna make me laugh
            And nothing has to change today
            You didn't mean to say: I love you
            I love you
            And I don't want to, ooh

            The smile that you gave me
            Even when you felt like dying

            We fall apart as it gets dark
            I'm in your arms in Central Park
            There's nothing you could do or say
            I can’t escape the way I love you
            I don’t want to
            But I love you, ooh
            Ooh, ooh
            Ooh, ooh
