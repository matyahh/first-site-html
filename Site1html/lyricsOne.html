    <h3> Musica - Your Power</h3>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        Try not to abuse your power
        I know we didn't choose to change
        You might not wanna lose your power
        But havin' it's so strange

        She said you were a hero
        You played the part
        But you ruined her in a year
        Don't act like it was hard
        And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
        No wonder why you didn't ask
        She was sleepin' in your clothes (in your clothes)
        But now she's got to get to class

        How dare you?
        And how could you?
        Will you only feel bad when they find out?
        If you could take it all back
        Would you?

        Try not to abuse your power
        I know we didn't choose to change
        You might not wanna lose your power
        But havin' it's so strange

        I thought that I was special
        You made me feel
        Like it was my fault, you were the devil
        Lost your appeal
        Does it keep you in control? (In control)
        For you to keep her in a cage?
        And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
        You said you thought she was your age

        How dare you?
        And how could you?
        Will you only feel bad if it turns out
        That they kill your contract?
        Would you?

        Try not to abuse your power
        I know we didn't choose to change
        You might not wanna lose your power
        But power isn't pain

        Hmm
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ha
        La-la-la-la-la
