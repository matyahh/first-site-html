            Things fall apart and time breaks your heart
            I wasn't there, but I know
            She was your girl, you showed her the world
            You fell out of love and you both let go

            She was cryin' on my shoulder, all I could do was hold her
            Only made us closer until July
            Now I know that you love me, you don't need to remind me
            I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?

            But I see her in the back of my mind
            All the time
            Like a fever, like I'm burning alive
            Like a sign

            Did I cross the line?
            Mm, hm

            Well, good things don't last (good things don't last)
            And life moves so fast (life moves so fast)
            I'd never ask who was better (I'd never ask who was better)
            'Cause she couldn't be (she couldn't be)
            More different from me (more different)
            Happy and free (happy and free) in leather

            And I know that you love me (you love me)
            You don't need to remind me (remind me)
            Wanna put it all behind me, but baby
            
            I see her in the back of my mind (back of my mind)
            All the time (all the time)
            Feels like a fever (like a fever), like I'm burning alive (burning alive)
            Like a sign

            Did I cross the line?
            You say no one knows you so well (oh)
            But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
            Valentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel
            I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
            And I wonder

            Do you see her in the back of your mind?
            In my eyes?

            You say no one knows you so well
            But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
            Valentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel
            I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
